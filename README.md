# mindustry_logic

This is the folder containing my logic files for
[Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry).

I am writing them in [hlml](https://github.com/calestialgem/hlml) and using
[hlml.java](https://github.com/calestialgem/hlml.java) for compiling them.

Also I have set the VS Code default build task to generate an `mlog` file for
the currently active editor. These settings should work as long as a JVM for
Java 21 or higher is available on the path.
